## Objective 
In the current scenario, there is too much job posting online and we got daily mail for this and that job posting in an organisation or a company. We look at it and it seems that this is the perfect job for you. But it is also possible that there is no such job and the job description is fake. They are trying to collect your data or personal information. So the project is on fake job description prediction is to predict whether the job description is given is genuine or this is for some malicious and job is fake and they are trying to just to fool you.
